# Microsoft US Education Azure OpenAI Workshop

[Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the Azure OpenAI service to create AI powered solutions. You will get hands-on experience with the latest AI technologies and will learn how to use Azure OpenAI API.

  > **IMPORTANT**: Authorization can take up to 10 business days

- [Azure Open AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) already provisioned and **text-davinci-003** model is deployed. The model deployment name is required in the Azure Deployment step below. **South Central US** is recommended region for deploying Azure Open AI.

- Required Resource Providers [How to Register Azure Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types)
  
  - Azure OpenAI
  - Microsoft.Search
  - Microssoft.Functions
  - Microsoft.Authorization
  - Microsoft.CognitiveServices
  - Microsoft.ManagedIdentity
  - Microsoft.KeyVault
  - Microsoft.Storage  
  - Microsoft.Insights 
  - Microsoft.Application
  - Microsoft.LogiApps

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed in your computer
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- Azure Cloud Shell is recommended as it comes with preinstalled dependencies.
- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html) is recommended if local laptops are used as pip install might interfere with existing python deployment.
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
        - **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
