72. ADP Legal Compliance: Troubleshooting Common Compliance Issues 

ADP is committed to ensuring that our clients are compliant with all legal regulations governing payroll management. A big part of that commitment is ensuring that our clients' employees are informed about their rights and are aware of any compliance issues that may affect their payroll.

Here are some common compliance issues that employees may face and tips on how to troubleshoot them:

1. Incorrect tax withholding: It's common for employees to be confused about how much tax they should be paying. If you believe that your tax withholding is incorrect, check your latest pay stub to see how much was withheld. If you think it's incorrect, contact your HR representative or ADP customer support immediately.

2. Missed overtime pay: In some cases, employees may not be paid for overtime worked. If you think you missed out on overtime pay, check your latest pay stub to see if it was recorded correctly. If not, contact your HR representative or ADP customer support immediately.

3. Incorrect or missing benefits: Employees may also face issues with their benefits, such as medical insurance, dental insurance or other benefits they are entitled to according to the company's policy. If you think you are missing out on benefits, check with your HR representative or ADP customer support for clarification.

4. Inaccurate timekeeping: Some employees may feel that their timekeeping is incorrect, and that they are not receiving proper compensation for their work hours. In this case, check your time clock or time sheet for any discrepancies, and contact your HR representative or ADP customer support if you need assistance.
