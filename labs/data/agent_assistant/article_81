ADP Maintenance: Ensuring Your Payroll and HR Systems are Updated

As an employee whose payroll is managed by ADP, you may have questions about how your payroll and HR systems are maintained and updated. At ADP, we take great pride in our commitment to providing reliable and efficient payroll and HR solutions. In this article, we will provide detailed information on how we maintain and update our systems to ensure that your payroll and HR needs are met.

Maintenance Schedule

We have a proactive maintenance schedule in place to keep our payroll and HR systems up-to-date and running smoothly. Our maintenance schedule includes regular system updates, software upgrades, and security patches to ensure optimal system performance. These updates also include enhancements to existing features or the addition of new features that can benefit our clients.

Types of Updates

When it comes to updates, we provide two types: Full and Patch updates. A full update is when we release a complete new version of our payroll and HR systems. This type of update includes new features and functionality, as well as improvements to existing ones. A patch update, on the other hand, is a smaller update that fixes any bugs or issues within the system.

Release Schedule

We release updates on a regular schedule, typically every quarter. We also have an emergency release process for any critical issues that need immediate attention.

Testing and Quality Assurance

Before any updates are released to our clients, they go through a rigorous testing and quality assurance process. We have a team of professionals who are responsible for testing and validating any changes made to the system to ensure there are no issues or errors.

Communication and Training

We understand that updates to our payroll and HR systems can lead to questions and concerns from our clients. That's why we have a robust communication and training process in place. Prior to any updates being released, we communicate the changes to our clients and provide training resources to ensure they are familiar with any new features or changes to existing ones.

Conclusion

At ADP, we take the maintenance and update of our payroll and HR systems very seriously. Our proactive approach to maintenance and updates, along with our rigorous testing and quality assurance processes, helps to ensure that our systems are operating at their best. With regular updates and enhancements, you can trust that your payroll and HR needs will always be met.
