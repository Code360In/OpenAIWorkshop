2. How to Set Up Direct Deposit with ADP 

Introduction
Direct deposit is a convenient way for employees to receive their paychecks as they do not have to go and deposit the check at the bank physically. Setting up direct deposit with ADP is a quick and easy process that requires you to have your bank account information on hand. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up direct deposit with ADP.

Step 1: Gather your bank account information
To set up direct deposit with ADP, you will need your bank's routing number and your account number. You can find this information on a check or savings account statement. You can also contact your bank representative to obtain this information.

Step 2: Log into ADP portal
Log into your ADP portal by visiting www.myadp.com. Enter your username and password to gain access to your account. If you do not have an account, ask your employer to provide you with the necessary credentials.

Step 3: Access the direct deposit screen
Once you are inside your ADP portal, click on the 'Pay' tab, followed by 'Direct Deposit'. This will bring up the direct deposit screen.

Step 4: Add your bank account information
On the direct deposit screen, select 'Add Account'. Enter your bank's routing number and account number into the fields provided. Ensure that you double-check the information to avoid errors that could cause a delay in receiving your paycheck.

Step 5: Choose the deposit method
After entering your bank account information, select the deposit method that you prefer. You can choose either a fixed dollar amount to be deposited each pay period or a percentage of your total pay. You can also choose to split your direct deposit between multiple accounts.

Step 6: Confirm your information
Once you have added your bank account information and selected your deposit method, review the information to ensure its accuracy. If all the information is correct, confirm that you have read and agree to the terms and conditions of direct deposit.

Step 7: Submit the information
Click on 'Submit' to finalize the process. You will receive a confirmation message that your direct deposit request has been successfully submitted.
