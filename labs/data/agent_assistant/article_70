Understanding Wage and Hour Laws with ADP Legal Compliance

As an employee with payroll managed by ADP, it is crucial to have a good understanding of wage and hour laws to ensure you receive fair compensation for your work. Wage and hour laws are put in place to protect employees from being underpaid, overworked or mistreated by their employers. This article answers some of the most common questions employees may have about wage and hour laws and how ADP is compliant with them.

What are Wage and Hour Laws?
Wage and hour laws are a set of federal and state regulations that aim to ensure fair labor practices. These laws dictate the minimum wage, overtime rates, and record-keeping responsibilities of employers. Wage and hour laws vary depending on your location, industry, and employer policies.

What is Minimum Wage?
Minimum wage is the lowest hourly wage that employers can pay to their employees. The current federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour; however, many states have their own minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal rate. Some cities and counties also have their own minimum wage rates. As an employee with payroll managed by ADP, you can always check your pay stub or speak to your manager to confirm your hourly wage.

What is Overtime?
Overtime refers to the amount of time worked beyond 40 hours per week. Most employers are required to pay their hourly employees overtime rates for any hours worked beyond 40 hours per week. The overtime rate is typically 1.5 times the employee's regular hourly rate. Salaried employees may also be entitled to overtime pay depending on their job duties and salary level. ADP ensures that employers comply with overtime laws to ensure you receive the correct pay for your hours worked.

What are Record-Keeping Requirements?
Employers are required to keep a record of their employee's hours worked, wages earned and other payroll data. This is to ensure that employees are paid correctly and fairly. As an employee, you can access your payroll records through ADP's self-service portal. If you suspect any errors in your pay, you can contact ADP's customer support to have the issue resolved.
