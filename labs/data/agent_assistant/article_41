42. ADP Performance Management: Setting Goals and Objectives 

Thank you for providing the title of the article "42. ADP Performance Management: Setting Goals and Objectives". This article provides information and guidance on how employees managed by ADP can set and achieve their goals and objectives through ADP's performance management platform.

ADP's performance management system helps employees create and maintain their individual development plans (IDPs) and provides tools and resources for setting meaningful and achievable goals. The platform also enables managers to provide feedback and support to their team members throughout the performance review process.

To get started on ADP's performance management platform, employees need to log in to the system and access their performance dashboard. From there, they can create or update their IDP, which includes setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Employees can also add resources, such as training or coaching, to their plans to support their goal attainment.

Once employees have set their goals, they can track their progress throughout the year by updating their performance dashboard. Through this dashboard, employees can also request feedback from their manager and track any performance appraisals or ratings they receive.

Managers also play an important role in ADP's performance management platform. They are responsible for reviewing and approving their team members' IDPs, providing regular feedback and coaching, conducting performance appraisals, and recommending performance ratings.

Overall, ADP's performance management platform provides employees with the tools, resources, and support they need to set and achieve their goals and objectives. By using this platform, employees can improve their skills and knowledge, build their careers, and contribute more effectively to their teams and organizations.
