33. ADP Time and Attendance: Understanding Your Schedule 

As an employee with payroll managed by ADP, it is important to understand your schedule and how to use the ADP Time and Attendance system. This system allows you to track your time worked, vacation and sick days, and access your pay and scheduling information.

To get started, log in to the ADP portal using your username and password. Once you are logged in, click on the Time and Attendance tab to access your schedule. Here, you can view your upcoming shifts, request time off, and view your timecard.

One of the key features of the ADP Time and Attendance system is the ability to request time off. Simply click on the Request Time Off button and choose the date(s) you would like to request. Your manager will receive a notification and can either approve or deny your request.

To view your timecard, click on the My Timecard button. This will display your weekly work hours, total hours worked, and any vacation or sick time used. You can also edit your timecard if you notice any errors.

Another useful tool in the ADP Time and Attendance system is shift swapping. If you are unable to work a scheduled shift, you can request a coworker to swap shifts with you. This feature allows for easier scheduling adjustments and can be done through the system.

In addition to viewing your schedule and timecard, you can also access your pay information through the ADP portal. This includes viewing your pay stubs, setting up direct deposit, and updating your tax withholding information.

In summary, understanding the ADP Time and Attendance system is essential for managing your schedule and accessing your payroll information. By utilizing the tools available, you can ensure accurate time tracking and seamless communication with your manager.
